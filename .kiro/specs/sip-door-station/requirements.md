# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ESP32 SIP Door Station is a smart door intercom system that enables remote door access control through SIP (VoIP) calling. When a visitor presses the doorbell button, the device initiates a SIP call to a pre-configured number. The person answering the call can then control door locks and lighting using DTMF tones. The system includes a web-based configuration interface for setup and testing, making it suitable for residential and small commercial applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to press a doorbell button to initiate a call to the resident, so that I can request entry to the building.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the doorbell button is pressed THEN the system SHALL initiate a SIP call to the pre-configured URI
2. WHEN the SIP call is initiated THEN the system SHALL maintain the call connection until the remote party hangs up or a timeout occurs
3. IF the SIP call fails to connect THEN the system SHALL retry the call attempt up to 3 times
4. WHEN the call is active THEN the system SHALL be ready to receive DTMF tones from the remote party

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a resident receiving the door station call, I want to remotely unlock the door by pressing a key on my phone, so that I can grant access to visitors without physically going to the door.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DTMF digit '1' is received during an active call THEN the system SHALL pulse the door relay for 2 seconds
2. WHEN the door relay is pulsed THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback on the web interface
3. IF multiple DTMF '1' digits are received within 5 seconds THEN the system SHALL ignore subsequent pulses to prevent relay damage
4. WHEN the door relay operation completes THEN the system SHALL log the action with timestamp

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a resident receiving the door station call, I want to control exterior lighting by pressing a key on my phone, so that I can improve visibility for visitors or security purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DTMF digit '2' is received during an active call THEN the system SHALL toggle the light relay state
2. WHEN the light relay is toggled THEN the system SHALL maintain the new state until the next toggle command
3. WHEN the light relay state changes THEN the system SHALL update the web interface to reflect the current state
4. WHEN the light relay operation completes THEN the system SHALL log the action with timestamp

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure Wi-Fi and SIP settings through a web interface, so that I can set up the door station without needing to modify firmware code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the device boots up THEN the system SHALL start a web server accessible on the local network
2. WHEN accessing the web configuration interface THEN the system SHALL display current Wi-Fi and SIP settings
3. WHEN new configuration values are submitted THEN the system SHALL validate the input format before saving
4. IF configuration validation fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages to the user
5. WHEN valid configuration is saved THEN the system SHALL restart the SIP service with new settings
6. WHEN configuration changes are applied THEN the system SHALL persist settings across device reboots

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer or tester, I want to test the door station functionality through a web interface, so that I can verify system behavior without physical hardware interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the web interface THEN the system SHALL display a virtual doorbell button
2. WHEN the virtual doorbell button is clicked THEN the system SHALL initiate a SIP call identical to the physical button
3. WHEN the web interface is loaded THEN the system SHALL display real-time status of both relays
4. WHEN relay states change THEN the system SHALL update the web interface within 1 second
5. WHEN the web interface is accessed THEN the system SHALL show the current SIP connection status

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the device to securely handle sensitive configuration data, so that Wi-Fi passwords and SIP credentials are protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the firmware is built THEN the system SHALL load configuration from environment variables
2. WHEN displaying configuration in the web interface THEN the system SHALL show masked values for sensitive fields
3. WHEN configuration is stored THEN the system SHALL use secure storage mechanisms provided by ESP-IDF
4. IF the device is reset to factory defaults THEN the system SHALL clear all stored credentials
5. WHEN accessing the web interface THEN the system SHALL require authentication if credentials are configured

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests for all system functions, so that I can ensure code quality and prevent regressions during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new functions are implemented THEN the system SHALL include corresponding unit tests using Unity framework
2. WHEN unit tests are executed THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 80% code coverage for business logic
3. WHEN hardware-dependent code is tested THEN the system SHALL use mocks or provide smoke tests
4. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL complete all tests within 30 seconds
5. IF any unit test fails THEN the build process SHALL fail and report the specific test failure
